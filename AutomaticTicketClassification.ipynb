Morgan Chase restricted my account by my debit card Tuesday XX/XX/2019. On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

Therefore, I request a one month payment extension with my Auto Loan Company, Chase. For the past almost fours years, my request for payment extension is granted. I have never been delinquent with my auto loan payment. However, On XX/XX/2019 my request for a one month payment extension was denied this year. I explained my situation to representative and the supervisor with no avail. After a lengthy discussion and waiting, I was informed the reason for the decline as it is not \\\" contractual ''. This reason for denial baffled me and therefore I emailed the office of XXXX XXXX Executive Director, Communications, JPMorgan Chase & Co. A representative contacted me and stated Chase will follow-up. About week later a representative of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office called. The representative shared her role was help resolve the matter. The representative via conference call contacted the department handing my request. After, reviewing my information my request was still denied based on \\\" policy changes ''. I requested an explanation and representative stated a letter will be mailed with explanation. I have received XXXX letters the reason for denial was not \\\" policy changes ''.

I realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation, product, or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted Chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank. \\n\\nI contacted Chase via a secured message on XX/XX/2019 explaining what happened and asked \\\" Is there a way to reverse this transaction, or do you have a contact at XXXX that can give me more information about the recipient? '' That XXXX, my message was reviewed and I received a response restating my original email and informing me that \\\" The transfer has been completed. However, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction. I called XXXX again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. They told me that all of the information about the transaction would in Chase 's system because I used the banks app to perform the transaction. She stayed on the line with me until I understood everything that I should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. I ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nWhen I called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. She then asked me why I needed this information and I explained my situation again. I was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that I needed to contact XXXX to get the information I was looking for. After I told her that I had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. She said that Chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. In both phone calls, they asked if I initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, it felt like Chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. These transactions are advertised as a \\\" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business.

I responded that I did not have a savings and I am only authorized user. Customer rep told me they would call me back in 10 minutes to keep the line open. I didnt receive a call back after an hour so I contacted chase. From the first call I thought someone was using my card fraudulently. I spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor XXXX who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. Called the catering company and card was declined. I then used my XXXX  XXXX card to pay for the order. XXXX XXXX texted me asking if I was authorizing purchase and I responded yes. Contacted caterer and XXXX  XXXX was declined. I contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed.

Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.\",\n\"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports\"],\n [{\n            'v': 14,\n            'f': \"14\",\n        },\n\"my grand son give me check for {$1600.00} i deposit it into my chase account after fund clear my chase bank closed my account never paid me my money they said they need to speek with my grand son check was clear money was taking by my chase bank refuse to pay me my money my grand son called chase 2 times they told him i should call not him to verify the check owner he is out the country most the time  date happen XX/XX/2018 check number XXXX claim number is XXXX with chase\",\n\"Checking or savings account\"],\n [{\n            'v': 15,\n            'f': \"15\",\n        },\n\"Can you please remove inquiry\",\n\"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports\"],\n [{\n            'v': 17,\n            'f': \"17\",\n        },\n\"With out notice J.P. Morgan Chase restricted my account by my debit card Tuesday XX/XX/2019. On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

Therefore, I request a one month payment extension with my Auto Loan Company, Chase. For the past almost fours years, my request for payment extension is granted. I have never been delinquent with my auto loan payment. However, On XX/XX/2019 my request for a one month payment extension was denied this year. I explained my situation to representative and the supervisor with no avail. After a lengthy discussion and waiting, I was informed the reason for the decline as it is not \\\" contractual ''. This reason for denial baffled me and therefore I emailed the office of XXXX XXXX Executive Director, Communications, JPMorgan Chase & Co. A representative contacted me and stated Chase will follow-up. About week later a representative of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office called. The representative shared her role was help resolve the matter. The representative via conference call contacted the department handing my request. After, reviewing my information my request was still denied based on \\\" policy changes ''. I requested an explanation and representative stated a letter will be mailed with explanation. I have received XXXX letters the reason for denial was not \\\" policy changes ''. I would like CFPB help in exploring the denial of my payment extension request especially since I have been clear reason for denial.\",\n\"Vehicle loan or lease\"],\n [{\n            'v': 21,\n            'f': \"21\",\n        },\n\"On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I made a {$300.00} payment to an online retailer using Chase quick pay with XXXX on the Chase website. I realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation, product, or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted Chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank. \\n\\nI contacted Chase via a secured message on XX/XX/2019 explaining what happened and asked \\\" Is there a way to reverse this transaction, or do you have a contact at XXXX that can give me more information about the recipient? '' That XXXX, my message was reviewed and I received a response restating my original email and informing me that \\\" The transfer has been completed. However, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction. I called XXXX again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. They told me that all of the information about the transaction would in Chase 's system because I used the banks app to perform the transaction. She stayed on the line with me until I understood everything that I should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. I ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nWhen I called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. She then asked me why I needed this information and I explained my situation again. I was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that I needed to contact XXXX to get the information I was looking for. After I told her that I had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. She said that Chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. In both phone calls, they asked if I initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, it felt like Chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. These transactions are advertised as a \\\" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business.

about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a

more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailer bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message wa reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer ha been completed however a you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claim department i wa directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent wa trying to get me to end the call a quickly a possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask or what word and phrase i should use to get the information i wa looking for i called who automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the bank app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the bank app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i wa once again transferred to the claim department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i wa looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there wa nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipient banking information wa not kept in the system in both phone call they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase wa not transparent about their policy regarding these type of transaction nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transaction are advertised a a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to

that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team\",\n{\n            'v': 0,\n            'f': \"0\",\n        }],\n [{\n

do include a method to opt out but have no additional information about the consequences many other people ive seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out and even more egregiously despite chase simply sending an email doing this they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out this is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out this is blatant malpractice by chase\",\n{\n            'v': 0,\n

declined i contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be she told me the cvv code was incorrectly being input by the
