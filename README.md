# Automatic Ticket Classification Case Study

## Problem Statement
For a financial company, customer complaints carry a lot of importance, as they are often an indicator of the shortcomings in their products and services. If these complaints are resolved efficiently in time, they can bring down customer dissatisfaction to a minimum and retain them with stronger loyalty. This also gives them an idea of how to continuously improve their services to attract more customers. 
These customer complaints are unstructured text data; so, traditionally, companies need to allocate the task of ealuating and assigning each ticket to the relevant department to multiple support employees. This becomes tedious as the company grows and has a large customer base.
In this case study, we will be working as an NLP engineer for a financial company that wants to automate its customer support tickets system. As a financial company, the firm has many products and services such as credit cards, banking and mortgages/loans. 
But, it is not explicitly mentioned in the dataset about the diseases and their treatment, but somehow, we need to build an algorithm to map the diseases and their respective treatment.
